Welcome to my GitHub page!

Note that not all of my coding activity will appear here - I often work on private version control hosts due to data sensitivity ðŸ˜‰

## Bio
Data scientist, analyst, statistican. My background is in Computer Science and I've worked with data throughout my professional career. In today's age effective data science involves incorporating lessons from the world of software engineering, and this idea is at the forefront of my personal development. Currently working as a statistican in the public sector. 

## Toolbox 
I love working with **R** for quick and efficient data dissection and analysis, such as facet_plot visualisation, correlation and colinearity analysis, data cleaning wth janitor and dplyr, and basic feature engineering. When it comes to ML and training complex models, I typically turn to **Python** with its extensive ML libraries and API support for working with Cloud services such as Azure and GCP for MLOps. For presenting, I love using **R Markdown**, **R Shiny**, **Power BI**, and **Jupyter**.

## Certifications
I hold a first class degree (BSc Hons.) in Computer Science from the University of Lincoln.
I qualified as a badged statistician with the Government Statistican Group (GSG) in 2020.
